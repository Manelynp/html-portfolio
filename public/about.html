<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Manelyn Paypa, I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease. I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time. Currently, I am looking for new career opportunities my current job position cannot provide.. Here's a little more about me:</p>

<p>I have five years of experience in a watch manufacturing company, specializing in Administrative tasks. I have worked with Industrial Engineering related projects and have a proven track record of participation in seminars and webinars with the Philippine Association of Secretaries. I am skilled in Microsoft tools such as excel, word, powerpoint, and I'm always eager to learn and grow in my professional journey.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton with my friends. I also love baking cupcakes, and I'm always up for trying new things.</p>

<p>One of my personal goals is to become a Web Designer. I am focused on front-end developer and constantly challenge myself to become a full stack Web Developer. I am determined to help clients needs and make a meaningful difference in Web Designing.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better! I'm passionate about Web Designing, and I'm excited about the possibilities ahead. I look forward to connecting with others who share similar interests and goals. Feel free to reach out to me to discuss about your business needs or explore potential collaborations.
